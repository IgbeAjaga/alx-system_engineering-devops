        End Time: January 15, 2023, 04:30 PM PST
    Impact:
        The user authentication service was down, causing a complete outage for all users attempting to log in. Approximately 70% of users were affected.
    Root Cause:
        The outage was caused by an expired SSL certificate on the authentication server.

Timeline:

    Issue Detected:
        January 15, 2023, 03:10 PM PST
    Detection Method:
        An engineer received multiple customer complaints about inability to log in.
    Actions Taken:
        Investigated server logs and identified SSL handshake failures.
        Assumed the issue was related to a recent software update.
    Misleading Paths:
        Initially suspected a recent software update but found no evidence to support it.
        Investigated network configurations, which were found to be unrelated.
    Escalation:
        Incident was escalated to the DevOps team after initial investigation.
    Resolution:
        Renewed the SSL certificate on the authentication server.

Root Cause and Resolution:

    Root Cause:
        The issue was caused by an expired SSL certificate. The server couldn't establish secure connections with users due to this expiration.
    Resolution:
        Renewed the SSL certificate on the authentication server, which involved generating a new certificate, installing it, and restarting the service.

Corrective and Preventative Measures:

    Improvements/Fixes:
        Implement automated SSL certificate expiration monitoring.
        Develop a notification system for expiring certificates.
        Create a runbook for quick certificate renewal.
    Tasks:
        Implement SSL certificate monitoring using a tool like Certbot.
        Develop a script to send email alerts for certificate expiration.
        Document the process for renewing certificates and update the incident response plan.
